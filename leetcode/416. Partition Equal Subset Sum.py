        dp[0][j] => Can we make a target of j given 0 items ? 
        dp[1][j] => can we make a target of j given 1 items ? 
        Since we can only either pick or dont pick an element, 

        say we choose to take the item with value 1, then we would then look at the previous row, with the target = j - current item value = 2 - 1 = 1
        hence take a look at dp[0][1] => which is False, thus current box would be False! 

        So the recurrance relation is dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-nums[i-1]]

        if we DONT pick the item, then we literally just copy from above us! dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]

        so how do we decide to pick the item or not ? 
        We ask the question, do we include the current item inside or not ?

        dp[j] = Can we make the sum j. Note that we would iterate through each num,

        for num in nums: # why ? => building our solution, given the numbers we have seen so far, what is the sum we can make ==> DP, since we are starting with a small subsets of coins 
            for ... 

        hence at the current dp[j], we would be considering to add the current number num. 
        Hence if we include the current num, then our sum would be dp[j-num]
            if we DONT include the current num, then we would be having the sum as the current sum dp[j] ==> dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j-num]

        j=2: dp[2] = dp[2] OR dp[1] = False OR True = True ‚Üê PROBLEM!

        We just set dp[1] = True in this same loop iteration. 
        But dp[1] = True means "we can make sum 1 using number 1". 
        Now we're using that to set dp[2] = True, which means "we can make sum 2". 

        But to make sum 2, we'd need to use the number 1 TWICE (1+1=2). We only have one copy of number 1, hence we repeated our value.

        # but how does going backward solve this ? 
        We only use results from the previous iteration, which means each number is counted exactly once.
